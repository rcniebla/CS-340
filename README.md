Client/Server Development
How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

In order to write maintainable, readable, and adaptable code I try to always keep the pillars of object oriented programing in mind. We ABSTRACT the mongo queries from the python code by only calling their function names and passing their parameters, which also shows how we ENCAPSULATE the code by separating the like functionality.  I try to implement INHERITANCE whenever possible by using a parent class or an interface that we can inherit from and finally I use POLYMORPHISM to overload functions most notably  constructots.  


How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

I try to think of the happy path first.  The way that we can make something in which if everything goes according to plan will work.  Then I branch out into the inevitable not so happy paths.  I also try to break the problem down into smaller chunks that I can handle independantly.  Finally, I normally revise the code I have after its functioning just to make sure it is functioning as opitimally as it can be.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better

Computer scientists can do quite a bit of everything in industires ranging from defense to entertainment.  Computer scientists create code that fits a need. In the defense industry maybe that is better encryption, for entertainment that might be automating a rig for a 3d model.  My work would help a company like Grazioso Salvare by listening to the wants of the company and making the website accessible for the user.
